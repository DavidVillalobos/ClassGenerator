# Generator of Projects C++ 

The purpose of this project is to optimize the project implementation process in C++,  
allowing classes to be created quickly. Only attributes are needed to implement the body   
and basic methods of the classes, methods such as constructors, getter and setter.  
This project was created with python.

Or download all 4 and use them with the help of the main.py  
All created files of c++ are stored on the current user's desktop
