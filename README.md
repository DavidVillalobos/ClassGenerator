# Generator of Projects C++ 

The purpose of this project is to optimize the project implementation process in C++,  
allowing classes to be created quickly. Only attributes are needed to implement the body   
and basic methods of the classes, methods such as constructors, getter and setter.  
This project was created with c++.

Unzip the file in the space where you want and for use run the GenC++.exe file    

### Last version
